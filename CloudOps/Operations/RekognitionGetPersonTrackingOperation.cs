        public override string Description => "Gets the path tracking results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by . The person path tracking operation is started by a call to StartPersonTracking which returns a job identifier (JobId). When the operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartPersonTracking. To get the results of the person path tracking operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartPersonTracking.  GetPersonTracking returns an array, Persons, of tracked persons and the time(s) their paths were tracked in the video.    GetPersonTracking only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the following response syntax are not returned.  For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  By default, the array is sorted by the time(s) a person&#39;s path is tracked in the video. You can sort by tracked persons by specifying INDEX for the SortBy input parameter. Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of items returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetPersonTracking and populate the NextToken request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetPersonTracking.";
